    "<b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a fantastic tool to add layout to your HTML websites. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images, advanced positions and many other things. CSS is a must for anyone working with web design.\n",

    "A short time ago, the language HTML was only used to add structure to text. An author could mark his text by stating \"this is a headline\" or \"this is a paragraph\" using HTML tags such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Web gained popularity, designers started looking for possibilities to add layout to online documents. To meet this demand, the browser producers (at that time Netscape and Microsoft) invented new HTML tags such as for example &lt;font&gt; which differed from the original HTML tags by defining layout - and not just structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also led to a situation where original structure tags such as &lt;table&gt; were increasingly being misused to layout pages instead of adding structure to text. Many new layout tags such as &lt;blink&gt; were only supported by one type of browser. \"You need browser X to view this page\" became a common disclaimer on web sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "CSS was invented to remedy this situation by providing web designers with sophisticated layout opportunities supported by all browsers. At the same time, separation of the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, makes site maintenance a lot easier. Your instructor was very guilty of continuing to use tables to layout webpages rather than learning the brand new CSS at the time. It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks! I actually still have some old webpages that don't properly use CSS. Don't be like me! CSS was a revolution in the world of web design and it's good for you to learn it along with the HTML you have just learned."
