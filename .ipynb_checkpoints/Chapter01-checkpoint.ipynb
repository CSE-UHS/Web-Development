By inventing HTML he laid the foundation for the web as we know it today.\n",

To see the HTML code of a page on the Internet, simply click \"View\" in the top menu of your browser and then Developer - View Source. This code might look complicated but if you want to make websites, there is no way around HTML. Even if you're using a program to create websites, such as Dreamweaver, a basic knowledge of HTML can make life a lot simpler and your website a lot better. The good news is that HTML is easy to learn and use. In fact, by the end of this first chapter you will have made your first website. (It won't be very impressive but you will feel a rush of power!)\n",

You label content by putting it between an opening tag and a closing tag. \n",
