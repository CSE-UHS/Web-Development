    "In the last chapter we learned how to collect data from a user with HTML forms. Perhaps we want to store that data somewhere to be used again in the future on our website. We can store data in databases. A database is a collection of information / data that is organized so that it can easily be retrieved, administrated and updated. Databases thereby enable the opportunity to create dynamic websites with large amounts of information. \n",

In this course, we will use the <b>MySQL</b> database. <b>MySQL</b> is the natural place to start when you want to use databases in PHP. <b>MySQL</b> is an open source relational database management system that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases. It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius' daughter, My. The SQL phrase stands for <b>Structured Query Language</b>.\n",
